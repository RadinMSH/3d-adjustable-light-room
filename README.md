Hi guys, this is another project created by me using THREE.js; this is a short description for it:
1. Try rotating the scene using your finger or left mouse
2. Try moving by swiping your fingers on the screen
3. Open and close the folders, or the full light controller panel
4. Change the color of the room light
5. Change the light's position in all (x,y,z) directions
6. Change the power, decay, intensity and...

Hope you all like this project!
